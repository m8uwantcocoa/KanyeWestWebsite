        Biography
        </h2>
        <h3  class = "english" >
            Early life
        </h3>
        <p class="english" >
            West was the child of an Atlanta-based news photographer and former Black Panther father,
            Ray West, and a college professor mother, Donda (née Williams) West. His parents divorced 
            when he was three, and West was raised by his mother mainly in the South Shore neighborhood 
            of Chicago, where she began teaching at Chicago State University. When West was 10 years old, 
            he moved with his mother to China for a year for an education exchange program in which Donda 
            West taught at Nanjing University. West showed artistic ability at a young age, often winning 
            talent shows as a child. He attended Chicago State University for one year before dropping out 
            to pursue a career in music.

            Notable
        </h3>
        <p class="english" >
            West spent much of late 2009 rehabilitating his image. He had rushed the stage at the MTV 
            Video Music Awards, preempting Taylor Swift’s acceptance speech for best female video, to 
            declare that “Beyoncé had one of the best videos of all time.” Video footage of the incident 
            quickly went viral on the Internet, and West found himself vilified in the media. A series of 
            apologies, some of them appearing as a stream-of-consciousness narrative on West’s Twitter 
            (rebranded as X in 2023) feed, soon followed.
        </p>
        <p class="english" >
            After the 2009 VMAs incident with Taylor Swift, Kanye West reinvented himself with the 
            release of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy (2010), hailed as a modern masterpiece. 
            Over the next decade, he pushed musical boundaries with albums like Yeezus and The Life of 
            Pablo, while exploring gospel with Jesus Is King (2019). Beyond music, Kanye became a fashion 
            icon with his Yeezy brand and stirred debate with his ventures into politics and religion. 
            Despite controversy, he remains one of the most influential and polarizing figures in modern 
            culture.
